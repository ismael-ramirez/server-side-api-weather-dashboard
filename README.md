This is a weather dashboard application for travelers. It 
provides a weather outlook for multiple cities with form 
inputs for planning trips accordingly. When you search for 
a city, you are presented with current and future conditions 
for that city, then that city is added to the search history.
When viewing current weather conditions for that city, you 
are then presented with the city name, the date, an icon 
representation of weather conditions, the temperature, 
the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index.When viewing 
the UV index you are presented with a color that indicates 
whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe. 
When viewing future weather conditions for that city then 
you are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays 
the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the 
temperature, and the humidity. When the icon of the city 
gets clicked in the search history then you are again 
presented with current and future conditions for that city. 
This application uses the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather
data and also localStorage to store persistent data. 
Application user interface is clean and easy to navigate.
